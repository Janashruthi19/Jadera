# Jadera Jewelry Shop Website

Hi, welcome to my Jadera repository! This is my university project, which is a jewelry website.

## Project Overview
- **Website:** Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring various products, blogs, testimonials, and more.
- **Chatbot:** Developed using Python, NLP, and Flask, designed to assist customers with queries related to shipping, promotions, and orders.

Both the website and chatbot were built by me to provide customer support and enhance the user experience.

Thank you for visiting!
